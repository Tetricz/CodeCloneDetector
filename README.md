- [Glenn Turner](https://github.com/glenntu15)

Progress to date 2023/4/7:

- Preprocess: remove comments and blank lines
- Hash code blocks and compare to find similar

Types of clones:

- Type 1: Almost exact match
- Type 2: Renamed variables
- Type 3: A few statements added, deleted or swapped
- Type 4: Semantic clone, but nothing looks the same

This project focuses on types 1 and 2.
